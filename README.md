Transportation is a major contributor to global carbon emissions, and inefficient travel routes and unsustainable commuting choices exacerbate the issue. At the heart of route optimisation lies the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a mathematical challenge that seeks the shortest route to visit multiple locations exactly once before returning to the starting point.
Our project applies TSP principles to develop a travel optimization system tailored for Jamaica. We analyze key destinations to determine the most efficient travel order, reducing total distance, travel time, and environmental impact. This system will empower individuals, businesses, and organizations to make informed, eco-friendly travel choices while lowering costs and minimizing carbon footprint.
Beyond logistics, our project promotes a sustainable future by encouraging responsible travel. We provide users with smarter, greener travel alternatives by integrating real-time traffic data, vehicle-specific optimizations, and eco-conscious recommendations. We aim to revolutionise travel in Jamaica, making it more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly.
Our Algorithm of choice is A*, as it provides the most efficient Capability of quickly navigating the path and finding near-optimal routes by taking into account both the actual cost from the source and the predicted cost to the destination.
